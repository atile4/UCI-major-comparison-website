# UCI-major-comparison-website
UCI course comparison website between majors

Data is retrieved by scraping UCI's course catalog.

**NOTE: This website is still experimental. There may be some bugs.**

## Known Issues
- Any majors that involve specializations are not separated.

- Courses that are listed as series (ie, COMPSCI 103-189) or explicitly listed are not counted.

- Any majors that have concentrations in different fields are not counted beyond their core requirements (i.e. Applied and Computational Mathematics).
